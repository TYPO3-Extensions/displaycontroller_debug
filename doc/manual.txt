Credits
Like extension "Display Controller", this extension relies on a library called Kint to dump the debug data in the frontend. Kint is developed by Rokas Šleinius. The project is hosted at  Google Code: http://code.google.com/p/kint/
Installation
This extension depends on extension "displaycontroller". Indeed it makes no sense without it. It also depends on jQuery and jQuery UI. These libraries can be loaded explicitly or used from your site, if already loaded. See "Configuration" below.
Configuration
This extension comes with two simple configuration options, to let it load the jQuery and jQuery UI libraries. If your site already loads either of these libraries, don't check the corresponding box and they won't be loaded a second time.
If your site uses a JavaScript library that conflicts with jQuery, you will unfortunately not be able to use this extension.
Users manual
Usage of this extension is very straightforward. All you need to do is click around the control panel that appears at the top of your page.
Unchecking the top checkbox (1) will hide all the debut output (as well as the other options of the control panel). Unchecking any of the other checkboxes (2) will hide the message with the corresponding severity level. Checking any box again will bring back the hidden elements.
Known problems
If you have any issues, please refer to the Tesseract Project web site (http://www.typo3-tesseract.com/). You may also post your problems to the TYPO3 English mailing list (typo3.english), so that others may benefit from the answers too. For bugs or feature requests, please open an entry in the extension's bug tracker on Forge (http://forge.typo3.org/projects/extension-displaycontroller_debug/issues).
